ArtemisAssignments
==================

Ever have a problem with your crew not wanting to switch stations?  
Ever have a crew member learn only one station and then refuse to try a new station?

I have, so I created a simple solution.  
ArtemisAssignments will randomly assign everyone to a station.

==================
Simple to use.
Just type the players name.  Click Add.  
Do this for as many players as you have.  Even more than six.
Once finished click on Get Assignments and players will be randomly chosen and assigned 
to a station.  


IMPORTANT
==================
When running ArtemisAssignments the DATA folder must be in the same folder as the ArtemisAssignments.exe



Have fun.
